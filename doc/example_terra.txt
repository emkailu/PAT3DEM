1. Simultaneous data transfer and preprocessing (drift correction, CTF, particle picking).
In a CENTOS6 operating system installed with XDOTOOL:
    ssh ldshen@terra.tamu.edu
    source preprocess.source (MUST check parameters)

If SKIP_DATATRANSFER="no", open a new tab,
    p3downloadrun.sh
Go back to the login tab, and then put the login window in background.
For parallel data transfer, specify a new PROJECT_FOLDER parameter and repeat the above steps.

Needs EMAN2, PAT3DEM, PARAMIKO, 'motioncor2' command, GCTF, and GAUTOMATCH. Ignore anisotropic magnification distortion for now.

2. Refinement.
In the PROJECT_FOLDER:
    sbatch ex_ptcl_001.job (MUST check parameters)
If particles are binned (by 2 for example) during extraction:
    mkdir bin2; mv particles.star Particles/ bin2/
In bin2/:
    sbatch 2d_001.job (MUST check parameters)
    sbatch 3d_class_001.job (MUST check parameters)
    sbatch 3d_auto_001.job (MUST check parameters)
