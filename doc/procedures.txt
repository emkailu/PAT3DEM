# Procedures to process electron microscopy (EM) data

1. BE ORGANIZED.
specimen_mag/subfolder/date/date_number, e.g.,
"PHN-GK_25K/Rawmovies/20151021/20151021_001.mrc"

2. PREPROCESS MOVIES.
***mag_distortion_correct
Correct anisotropic mag distortion, see Zhao et al., 2015, and Grant & Grigorieff, 2015.

***p3movie.py
1)Align frames: ITERATIVELY align each frame with the current best total sum.
2)Output lowdose/lowdose2 sum/movie.
①Do not use filter, as it may affect CTF and SNR.
②Skip the first few frames due to beam induced drift, as it may affect CTF and SNR.
③Lowdose2 e.g., if you have 100 25-frame movies and 100 50-frame movies, then do a 25-frame movie processing using the 200 movies and a 50-frame movie processing using the 100 movies, finally merge them, which may not give better results than the 25-frame movie processing using the 200 movies.
3)For faster processing (at the speed of data transfer), submit a job running ***p3movierun.py to cluster, and then run ***p3downloadrun.sh locally.

3. CTF.
***p3ctf.py
1)Based on unfiltered lowdose/lowdose2 movie.
2)Choose good parameters.
①Increase the minimum resolution to "just before" the first zero of the CTF.
②Increase the maximum resolution to approximately where ctffind reports detecting rings.
③Choose a right defoci range.
3)For faster processing, run ***p3ctfrun.py.

***p3ctfscreen.py
Screen based on the output of p3ctf.py.

4. LOCATE PARTICLES.
***e2boxer
1)Low-pass filter to see particles clearly.
2)Erase: ①bad area; ②big no-particle area.
3)Swarm tool:
①Box size: ideally D+2R, R=λΔF/d, see Rosenthal & Henderson, 2003. D is diameter of particles, λ=0.025Å for 200 keV, ΔF is defocus, d is target resolution.
②Change threshold so that visible particles are not excluded.
③Delete bad boxes (if the whole micrograph is bad, clear boxes).
④Finish one micrograph before processing the next.
4)Exclude bad micrographs (boxes cleared to 0).

***relion_preprocess
1)Stddev for white/black dust removal. Always use -1. If it doesn't work, find and exclude the bad particles.

***p3starcoord.py
Get coordinates from star files, consider _rlnOriginX and _rlnOriginY if they are in the star files.

***p3starmerge.py
1)Merge star files containning particles, and regroup.
2)Regroup, if only one star file was given.

5. SCREEN PARTICLES.
***p3micscreen.py
Screen micrographs based on outputs of p3movie.py and p3ctf.py, modulated by numptcl and defocus.

***relion_refine
1)2D:
①Not super-accurate.
②Ignore CTFs until first peak.
③Clean background beyond particles is good.
④Density variation within particles is good.
2)3D: Try different parameters to make it work.

***p3starscreen.py
Write two new star files after screening by an item in the star file.

6. GOLD-STANDARD REFINEMENT.
***SIMPLE
Generate an initial model.

***relion_refine
1)It's not always necessary to low-pass filter the initial model.
2)Largest memory is used when each iteration is initialized.
3)Movie processing: ①Masking is not necessary; ②Use running average to get enough SNR.
4)Masking after several iterations may not be as optimal as from the first iteration.

7. INTERPRET MAPS.
***p3xml.py
Convert xml to txt and optionally display it.

***p3recrand.py
Reconstruct from randomly selected particles from _data.star.

***p3cuboidgen.py
Generate a cuboid on the grid of input image.

***p3cuboidvalue.py
Output the values of voxels within a coordinate range, 'x1 x2 y1 y2 z1 z2'.

***p3pdbdev.py
Output pdb1, whose B-factor is replaced by CA deviation between pdb1 and pdb2.

RUN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS WITHOUT ANY OPTIONS TO GET REFERENCES OF DEPENDENCIES.
