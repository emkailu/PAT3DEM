# procedures to process electron microscopy (EM) data

1. be organized
1)create one folder for one project, usually named by specimen and magnification, e.g., 'Mtb70S-29K/'
2)under the project folder, use subfolders, e.g., 'Rawmovies/' for raw movie stacks
3)under subfolders, use subsubfolder, usually named by date, e.g., '20150911/'
4)under subsubfolder, use a UNIQUE name for each micrograph, usually named by date and a serial number, e.g., 20150911_001.dm4
5)three e.g.:
'Mtb70S-29K/Rawmovies/20150911/20150911_001.dm4'
'Mtb70S-29K/Micrographs/20150911/20150911_001.mrc'
'Mtb70S-29K/Micrographs/bad/20150912_005.mrc'

2. preprocess movies
***p3movie.py
1)align frames (ITERATIVELY align each frame with the current best total sum)
2)apply a dose-dependent filter (RNA/DNA tolerate ~2 times higher dose than proteins)
3)output fulldose sum, lowdose sum, and lowdose averaged movies

3. ctf
***p3ctf.py
1)based on fulldose sum
2)contribution of amplitude contrast is 5%–10% for cryo-EM (use 10%)

***p3defscreen.py
screen based on the defocus value output by ctffind4

4. locate particles
***e2boxer
1)low-pass filter to see the particles clearly
2)erase: ①bad area; ②big no-particle area
3)swarm tool:
①box size: ideally D+2R, R=λΔF/d, see Rosenthal & Henderson, 2003. D is diameter of particles, λ=0.025Å for 200 keV, ΔF is defocus, d is target resolution
②change threshold so that visible particles are not excluded
③delete bad boxes (if the whole micrograph is bad, clear boxes)
④finish one micrograph before processing the next
4)exclude bad micrographs (boxes cleared to 0)

5. screen micrographs
***p3micscreen.py
